# Neoton Translation #
Neoton uses standard GNU `gettext` localization engine with PHP. Here you can find Russian translation as an example. To use it, copy the `neoton-ru_RU.mo` file into the following location: `engine/lang/ru_RU/LC_MESSAGES/neoton.mo`. 

## Translate Neoton ##
To make localization of Neoton for your language, use `gettext` utilities or graphical `POEdit` utility. Don't forget to add `*.tpl` files into the PHP extension list when extracting the strings. Alternatively you can just use Russian translation as an example: it will always have actual set of strings because Russian language is maintained by the author of Neoton.
